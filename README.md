# parallel
My assignment will utilize parallelization in image processing.
It will receive an image and apply a filter to it. First with a sequential method and then using OpenMP.
Also will include performance tests with different resolution pictures and different filters.
The program will go and apply a filter pixel by pixel. This can be parallelized.
Parallel thread number will be variable, or "smart", depending on workload heavinness. Depends on if i have time.
The program should have three versions, including one based on POSIX thread manipulation, one based on OpenMP and the third version will utilize MPI.

I might want to reroll and try to parallelize the smoke of the car in the "graphics" repository. We shall see.
