# parallel
My assignment will utilize parallelization in image processing.
<br It will receive an image and apply a filter to it. First with a sequential method and then using OpenMP. />
<br Also will include performance tests with different resolution pictures and different filters. />
<br The program will go and apply a filter pixel by pixel. This can be parallelized. />
